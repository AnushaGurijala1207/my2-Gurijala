### My favorite vacation spot is Hyderabad, India.

I absolutely love **Hyderabad**. One of my favorite things to do is visit the **Charminar** at night. The way it lights up is simply magical. And spending time with friends at **Golconda Fort** is always a blast. But the real star of Hyderabad is the **Hyderabadi Biryani**. It's a flavor explosion that you can't miss!
